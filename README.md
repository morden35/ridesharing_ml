## Abstract
The emergence of ridesourcing providers such as Uber and Lyft have prompted
numerous questions around urban mobility, the gig economy, and environmental
sustainability—among other topics. While recent research focuses on the benefits
and limitations of ridesharing, we explore the factors affecting customers’ willingness
to share rides with other customers (i.e., ridesplitting). In particular, we
integrate ridesourcing trip data featuring cost, time and spatial variables with socioeconomic
and demographic data for Chicago, IL and train Lasso Regression and
Random Forest models to predict customers’ willingness to share rides with other
customers. After accounting for multicollinearity in our data, we find that trip-level
factors—namely cost and distance—and community area-level factors—namely
percentage of white population and median income—are among the top features
affecting customers’ willingness to split rides. The identified patterns can help
the city’s policymakers identify community areas with the greatest potential to
promote ridesplitting as the debate on ridesourcing behavior evolves.
